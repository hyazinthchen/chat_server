# chat_server
Chat program based on TCPv6 sockets

## Project descripton
This application was an assignment for a class at university. It is by no means bug-free. 

## How to use
Start the server in this manner: Server.exe Serverport name

If more arguments than port and name are passed, those that are too many are ignored.

If there are too few arguments, the application terminates itself.
